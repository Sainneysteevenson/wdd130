# WDD130 — Project

A short description of the project and how to view it.

✅ Correct submission URL: https://Sainneysteevenson.github.io/wdd130

How to view:
- Ensure there is an `index.html` at the repository root (or place site files in `/docs` and select that folder for Pages).
- GitHub Pages will publish the site at the URL above once Pages is enabled.

Steps to publish (quick checklist):
1. Confirm repository name
   - The repo must be exactly named `wdd130`.

2. Ensure there is an entry point
   - Add an `index.html` at the repository root (or in `/docs`).
   - If you use a build step, push the built site to the branch/folder you select for Pages.

3. Enable GitHub Pages
   - Go to your repository Settings → Pages.
   - Under "Source" select the branch (usually `main`) and folder (`/root` or `/docs`) where `index.html` lives, then Save.
   - Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build and publish.

4. Verify the site
   - Visit: https://Sainneysteevenson.github.io/wdd130
   - Or run: `curl -I https://Sainneysteevenson.github.io/wdd130` and check for an HTTP 200 response or redirect to `/index.html`.

5. Make the repo public
   - Confirm repository visibility is public so instructors can access the URL.

Optional: Deploy using the `gh-pages` branch
- Build locally and push the compiled site to a `gh-pages` branch, then set Pages source to that branch.
- The published URL will still be: https://Sainneysteevenson.github.io/wdd130

Notes:
- If you change your GitHub username, update the submission URL accordingly in this README.
- If you want, I can also create a simple starter `index.html` and push it for you; tell me if you want that.
